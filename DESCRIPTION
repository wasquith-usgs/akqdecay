Description: Compute distributional statistics of hydrograph recession (decay) based on
  N-day-over-day changes of daily-mean streamflows for an arbitrary number of U.S.
  Geological Survey streamgages. Computations are oriented around what are termed
  Asquith--Knight discharge decay analyses. The analyses are focused on the distributional
  properties of the N-day-over-day changes, and such changes are defined herein as the
  inverse of the difference in logarithms of daily-mean streamflow and hence have units of
  days per log-cycle change. L-moments are computed to summarize distributional geometry
  of these changes, and so-called Gfactors (geologic factors) are computed as P-percentiles
  of the changes. Several utilities for data extraction and  manipulation are provided.
  Hydrograph rises or no change periods can also be considered. Considerable flow-
  duration curve computations can also be made.
