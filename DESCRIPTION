Description: Compute distributional statistics of hydrograph recession (decay) based on
  N-day-over-day changes of daily-mean streamflows for an arbitrary number of U.S.
  Geological Survey streamgages. Computations are oriented around what are termed
  Asquith--Knight discharge decay analyses. The analyses are focused on the distributional
  properties of the N-day-over-day changes, and such changes are defined herein as the
  inverse of the difference in logarithms of daily-mean streamflow and hence have units of
  days per log-cycle change. L-moments are computed to summarize distributional geometry
  of these changes, and so-called Gfactors (geologic factors) are computed as P-percentiles
  of the changes. Hydrograph rises or no change periods can also be considered. Considerable
  flow-duration curve computations can also be made, and many powerful utilities for data
  annual and decadal computation and manipulation are implemented including daily
  streamflow separation with roll up to monthly values.
